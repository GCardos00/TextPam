    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks
\n\n love fish
\n\n The king that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the oceans.
\n Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river
\n\n I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\n\n sometimes I even go fishing.
\n And even less sometimes, I actually catch something
\n\n Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry. I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\ 'll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\n You should ask someone else about fishing, though. \n\n    </string>
